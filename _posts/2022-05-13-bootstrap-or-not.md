Switching to Bootstrap was quite a big decision because it required me to rework a lot of this site to make it work.

Using Bootstrap has been something that I've wanted to do for quite a while, really ever since I had first heard about it. The whole concept is neat- it basically does the difficult styling work for you, which means that I can spend more time working on the actual site content, rather than trying to make it look good. It also means that now the site is mobile-optimized, so now you can experience this site no matter what device you're on (unless it's really old or doesn't support current SSL certificates).

I would like to take a moment to acknowledge what I lost in the transition: themes. While you can style Bootstrap pretty well, it's not something that can be done easily outside of the HTML. That means that themes had to be removed. While I'm a bit disappointed that I can't use the themes I spent a decent amount of time on, I feel like the pros outweigh the cons overall.

Now, the big question is will I be applying the same changes to the NCX Programming website. The short answer is maybe. I'm probably going to try it out sometime soon and see how it looks. If I like it, I'll go through with it. If not, then it'll stay as it is for the forseeable future. I don't really have any issues with the current styling anyway.

**Update (June 2022):** I did end up converting the NCX Programming website to Bootstrap, as it worked really well.
