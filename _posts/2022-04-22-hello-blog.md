It's blog time (again)! This is where I will talk about tech things I'm doing or like. Oh and also where I'll rant about things I could just ignore.

In all seriousness, I decided to branch off from the NCX Programming blog because I felt that my ramblings and rant-style articles were more of a "me" thing and less of an NCX Programming thing. I'll still write articles of the NCX Programming blog just as infrequently as before, this is just a different place where you can hear me shout.

So here's to a new blog, hopefully filled with fewer spelling mistaeskfs.
