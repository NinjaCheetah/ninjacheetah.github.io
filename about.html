<h1>hey there!</h1>

    I'm <strong>Campbell</strong> (he/they), an 18yo bisexual demiboy furry femboy software developer. Yes, I know I really hit 
    every stereotype, but I'm proud of all these parts of who I am. You probably know me as <strong>NinjaCheetah</strong>, either 
    from this very site or from one of the many other sites I hold that username (or some variation of it) on. I love making 
    things that I'll use and I love when other people also use the things I make.
</p>
<p>
    I'm currently studying Computer Science at the <a href="https://rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, 
    starting in Fall 2025. That picture up above is me standing on a giant snowbank on campus! We got a lot of snow
    this year.

    I'm also the proud boyfriend <a href="https://damidoop.xyz">Maple (DamiDoop)</a>.

    When it comes to what I actually do, I do a whole mess of things. I develop in primarily Python and Swift right now, but I'm 
    also playing around in Kotlin to make an Android app and am forced to use Java for my Computer Science II class. You can see 
    all of the things I've made over on the projects page, but my most notable creations are probably 
    <a href="https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/NUSGet">NUSGet</a> (which you'll know for sure if you've modded a Wii since the start 
    of 2026) and <a href="https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/TigerDine">TigerDine</a> (which you hopefully know about if you're a 
    fellow RIT student, and if you didn't well now you do). If you're familiar with the awesome project
    <a href="https://wiilink.ca">WiiLink</a> and have used their fancy GUI patcher, I'm also the one who made 
    <a href="https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/libWiiPy">the library</a> that made that new patcher possible.
</p>
<p>
    I also adore modding game consoles, especially Nintendo consoles, and <em>especially</em> the Wii U. At my peak I owned a grand
    total of about 15 Wii Us, which I'll be the first to admit was absurd, but hey they were cheap and 13/15 worked no issue. I
    also love the Wii, and have put a lot of time into poking around and messing with things on it. One of my
    <a href="{% post_url 2021-01-30-wii-dvd-p1 %}">earliest blog articles</a> was about trying to un-hide the typically 
    invisible DVD image in the disc channel, and dealing with the software required to do that was what motivated me to start 
    on libWiiPy, NUSGet, and everything that's been downstream of that, so it's safe to say that the Wii had a big impact on 
    my earlier programming work.

    Furry-wise, my fursona is an American marten! They're silly lanky guys like me. I am by no means an artist at the moment, 
    but hey, I'm working on it, and you can see my best attempt here on the left. My friend helped me design my fursona and 
    made the ref sheet for it, and you should go check them out <a href="https://toyhou.se/meteor-showerz">here</a>! They have 
    been offering me a lot of help in learning how to actually make art good so that I can hopefully make some cool drawings of 
    my sona in the future. You can see the ref sheet they made for me 
    <a href="https://toyhou.se/meteor-showerz/art#111615674">here</a>. If I make some cool stuff I want to share I may add a
    dedicated page for it on this site in the future...
