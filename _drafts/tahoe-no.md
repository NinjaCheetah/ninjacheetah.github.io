desc: The Tahoe icons fail across the board, from ruining a legacy of icon design to failing to convey meaning in a way that's easily recognizable.

I've always tended to be an early adopter of Apple's software updates. I install the day 1 developer beta on my devices after WWDC each year, and then suffer the consequences of doing so (but hey, it's really fun to watch the improvements between the early betas). I stuck with that trend this year on my phone, but when it came to my Mac, I held off. I didn't have a supported Mac any previous year, but if I had been in the position to I would've installed the Sonoma or Sequoia betas when they release with no hesitation. Tahoe, however, was different.

I'm not a huge fan of Liquid Glass as a whole, but for the most part I've come to terms with it and was curious about it when it was new. I like that it makes things a bit less flat, but there are so many various glaring issues with it across all of Apple's OSes that I can't possibly say it's _good_. Either way, that wasn't my biggest concern with the design refresh. What got me was the icons. (And in my case, I mean the app icons. But don't worry, I recently discovered a great article by Nikita Prokopov talking about Tahoe's [other icon problem](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/).) The \*OS 26 icons aren't amazing on any platform, but on iOS they weren't super different from the ones that were already in use, and overall add a bit more depth that I think is nice. On macOS though, the new icons brought changes that immediately bothered me. macOS icons have a unique style to them dating all the way back to OS X 10.0, and these icons seemed to be throwing that aside.

## What We Had

Before we can talk about Tahoe's icons, though, we need to talk about Big Sur's icons. When Apple last dramatically redesigned macOS in Big Sur, the icons followed suit and got an iOS-inspired look, in some cases using the exact same icon with an added depth effect between the layers. It was a good push towards making the icons uniform while still preserving the extra fun details that made Mac icons unique. And that's not just me talking, during the Big Sur reveal video Apple themselves said, "But we also love that Mac icons have a deep history and a distinct look and feel. So we've retained many of the highly crafted details and the playful elements that make Mac icons unique."<sup>[\[WWDC 2020\]](https://www.youtube.com/live/GEZhD3J89ZE?t=4276)</sup> These are details that have existed through most of the OS' history, so throwing them away would be crazy, right? Right?

Let's take a look at an example of this. GarageBand is one of my favorite examples of a _good_ icon redesign. The GarageBand icon that had been in use prior to Big Sur was a 3D guitar in front of your average amp. Like most OS X era icons, it was entirely freeform with just the two shapes next to each other. When they redesigned it, they simplified the amp down and made that fit the new shape constraints, but then kept the 3D guitar and let it break free from the icon's frame.

*An example of a good redesign that preserved the details of the original icon.*

This icon does something that I absolutely adored from the Big Sur icon style: it uses a rounded square base to fit the format, and then has a 3D element that break frees of those constraints. It does a really good job of allowing for consistency without removing the fun details that made these icons memorable from previous versions of macOS. And GarageBand was far from alone, the majority of macOS icons that had some sort of eye-catching 3D object kept it in the transition to Big Sur.

But then, Tahoe came along. In Tahoe, the rounded square template isn't a suggestion anymore; Apple decided to make it a hard requirement. Icons that don't fit it are shrunk and placed on a square grey background. Unfortunately, this change means that these fun details had to go away, because 3D objects could no longer float outside of the square. This meant a new wave of redesigns, and my first wave of concern.

## What We Got

I think talking about Finder has already been done to death, so I'm not going to dwell on it for long, but it would be wrong of me to not mention it at all. Finder was one of the first Tahoe icons I properly saw, and I was immediately put off by it. Myself and many, many others were not a fan of Apple's bizarre decision to swap the colors of each half of Finder's face. Of all apps to make such a dramatic change to, Finder was kind of insane choice. The face has been colored the way it is since System 7.5.1 in _1995_. It's absolutely the single most recognizable icon in the entire operating system.

*Immediately screwing up Finder in beta 1 was a bad sign for the future.*

If the questionable choices had ended there, I would've been perplexed but ultimately fine with the whole ordeal since they did swap the colors back to the way they were supposed to be in 26.0 Beta 2. (Though perplexingly this is only true for the light icon, the dark icon _still_ [has the blue on the right side](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/Finder-Tahoe-Dark.png).) Unfortunately though, it did not end there.

Like I said though, critiquing the Tahoe Finder design has been done to death already. There are plenty of other examples of new icons that completely abandoned their unique design to become boring or even entirely unhelpful. My goal here isn't just to bitch and moan about them though, I want to convey exactly how I feel they fail to uphold their legacy and convey what the hell they actually do.

Let's continue with Xcode, which I consider to be the most egregious example. (And I develop iOS apps so I have to stare at it _a lot,_ meaning I've had a lot of time to build up my frustration over it.)

Here's the progression of the Xcode icon over the years, from 2005 until now:

![](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/Xcode-comparison.png)
*Does one in particular maybe feel a little out of place to you too?*

Hmm.

The Xcode icon being a blueprint has always felt like a really clever deign choice to me. And in Big Sur, I think it was actually one of Apple's best icons overall. It's easily recognizable, and has plenty of small details put into it.

But in Tahoe? Well, it's a hammer. The grid behind it _kind of_ looks like a blank blueprint, but even then it's a _blank_ blueprint. The visual motif of the App Store is completely gone, and with it went the icon's history.

This change to the Xcode icon also lends itself to being an example of my second issue with the Tahoe icons: a lack of any clearly defined meaning. If you had no idea what an Xcode was, but you looked at any of its icons prior to Tahoe and put some thought into it, you could most likely come up with the correct answer that this is a tool for making apps. Especially on Big Sur, if you put it right next to the App Store icon and see that they have the same base. The App Store is an A, this is the blueprint for that A, they're obviously related _somehow_.

But could you do the same with the Tahoe Xcode icon? I mean seriously, think about it. If you had no idea what Xcode was for, I don't think you would reasonably be able to deduce its purpose from looking at the icon alone. Obviously it's not a requirement that every single app has an elaborate icon that perfectly conveys what the app is used for, but I think that it should at least be detailed enough that you can take an educated guess. And I think it's especially ridiculous to simplify that meaning away when it's been communicated well for the past _20 years_. They figured out how to convey meaning perfectly. Why abandon that?

Aw crap hold on, my sink is leaking again. Anyone have a wrench I could borrow?

*Disk Utility, ColorSync Utility, AppleScript Utility, and Wireless Diagnostics. Note that the dark mode Disk Utility and Wireless Diagnostics icons were manually recreated from their components because extracting Tahoe icons is weird.*

Oh thank god.

I'm not going to try and pretend that most of these icons were anything special before, because the latter three are all simple configuration utilities of one form or another that were tools behind a badge of some kind. Now, in Tahoe, they've been made completely uniform. I mean really, besides changing the gradient on the wrench a little bit for whatever reason, the main difference between these three icons is the, relative to the size of the icon as a whole, fairly small hexagon in the center.

For the latter three, conveying meaning isn't *quite* as important here, so I'm going to say they're actually not bad. Editing your color profile, dealing with AppleScript files, and diagnosing WiFi issues aren' really things that are super easily conveyed through the app icon alone. A rainbow, a little AppleScript icon, and the WiFi symbol are probably the best we could expect, and I think that they're okay in this context. These three were generic before, and now they're generic *and* uniform, which I'd say is a net positive.

But then there's the new player that joined this set of matching icons in Tahoe.

Disk Utility?? What about that first icon conveys _Disk Utility_? It's just an Apple logo on a white background. Let's pause and look at these side by side, just to make sure that we're on the same page:

![](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/DiskUtility-comparison.png)
*Disk Utility might not have been a looker but like... c'mon guys.*

Just like Xcode, Disk Utility is another example of both an icon's legacy and meaning being entirely stripped away. The old icon was clearly a tool for dealing with disks; it's a stethoscope on a hard drive, and that's what it has always been since its introduction in OS X 10.3 (2003). But what the hell does an Apple in a wrench mean? You can maybe guess that it's some form of system configuration, but disk management would not be at all on my radar if I didn't already know what it was.

Uniformity between the simple configuration apps is good. They're all for one specialized task, but are all configuration of some kind, so I like that they use the same base with a different center to indicate the specific purpose. But Disk Utility isn't that. It's a fairly major app that the average user is actually likely to interact with and be at least moderately familiar with. Not everyone will need to modify their color profile or manage their expansion slots (it wasn't included in the above collection of icons, but the Mac Pro specific Expansion Slot Utility also follows the same format), but I would say at least a healthy majority of users will need to format a drive at some point in their time using macOS.

My point isn't that the format of the icons itself is bad, but that this is a really poor application of it. A commonly used app shouldn't have a generic looking icon that could blend in with others, and especially shouldn't have an icon that does not inherently represent what the app does whatsoever. I mean seriously this still really bothers me, how does an Apple logo alone represent disk management?

Alright, I have one last major example to show off. I give you, Preview:

![](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/Preview-comparison.png)
*Hey, it's Inkscape! Oh, wait, that's not an inkwell.*

The Preview icon from Big Sur is fun, it's the same example photo that they had been using since OS X 10.10 (2014) with a very clear desk paper magnifier thing that, while looking in `Assets.car` to extract the icon, I learned is called a [loupe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loupe). It's also fun that it's outside the icon's frame, because it's like you have the loupe sitting on your desk ready to look at a real printed photo.

In Tahoe, they have completely abandoned the example photo and just have the loupe on its own, which, before anything else, I just find pretty bland. Additionally, while you can tell what it is and read the little "PREVIEW 10X" when it's big, you lose all of that clarity once you scale it down to actual app icon size. I've seen it on my phone for almost a year now, and my Mac for several months, and I _still_ see it as an inkwell first every time I look at it. I mean it's the right shape, and I expect to see a photo in Preview's icon so I don't really see this and think Preview. It gets even worse when using dark mode, because the black background and darker glass almost makes it look (to me at least) like there's ink inside!

Maybe the ink thing is just me. But either way, I think it has also lost a lot of its meaning. I'm not going to claim the average person was able to recognize the loupe and knew what it was for when looking at the Big Sur icon, but at least with the context of the photo you could make a reasonable guess. And really, that's what I think the standard should be. An icon does not need to provide a detailed look into what an app is for, but it should, at worst, let you take a pretty decent guess at what the app you're about to launch does. You might not know what a loupe is, but the photo means you'd probably guess that Preview has something to do with images, and from there you might guess that it's specifically for viewing them.

Big Sur and the macOS versions before it did this well. Tahoe does not.

## The macOS Icon Legacy

And now we arrive at the part where I need to summarize my thoughts.

I understand that the design of app icons is a somewhat subjective matter. Not everyone is going to have the same ideas on what makes a good icon. But I also know that a large portion of macOS users are very fond of its design, and the way that it has evolved while still maintaining the same general identity over the years. I might only be about 50% of a Mac user, but I'm still one of those people. Regardless of your thoughts on macOS as a platform, you can't deny that the way it looks is a huge part of what the operating system is, and that a lot of people are really fond of it.

While the general look and feel of the operating system is incredibly important, people aren't going to specifically remember the corner radius of a window or the translucency of the sidebar as much as they're going to remember the icon of the app that they saw them in. A small picture is much more memorable than the general design of the interface.

For me personally, I grew up on good old OS X Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009). I haven't used it properly in years now, but its icons still stand out in my head. I can picture the glossy look of things like Time Machine and Safari, and the 3D objects like the DVD Player remote and the Number bar graph. I was only barely using macOS just to kinda mess around at the time they announced Big Sur, but even still I was excited to see that despite changing the whole interface, they were still preserving the key bits of the icons I remembered seeing every day as a kid, because I was worried that they wouldn't after hearing rumors of the impending macOS redesign.

I'm aware that there are bigger concerns with even just within macOS than its app icons. But I still can't help but feel sad seeing something I was so familiar with and that had roots going back to several years before I was even born (!!) get erased. Is there any chance at getting my app icons back come WWDC 26? Probably not. But I can still hope.
