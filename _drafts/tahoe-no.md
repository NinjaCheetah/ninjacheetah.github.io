desc: The Tahoe icons fail across the board, from ruining a legacy of icon design to failing to convey meaning in a way that's easily recognizable.

I've always tended to be an early adopter of Apple's software updates. I install the day 1 developer beta on my devices after WWDC each year, and then suffer the consequences of doing so (but hey, it's really fun to watch the improvements between the early betas). I stuck with that trend this year on my phone, but when it came to my Mac, I held off. I didn't have a supported Mac any previous year, but if I had been in the position to I would've installed the Sonoma or Sequoia betas when they release with no hesitation. Tahoe, however, was different.

I'm not a huge fan of Liquid Glass as a whole, but for the most part I've come to terms with it and was curious about it when it was new. I like that it makes things a bit less flat, but there are so many various glaring issues with it across all of Apple's OSes that I can't possibly say it's _good_. Either way, that wasn't my biggest concern with the design refresh. What got me was the icons. (And in my case, I mean the app icons. But don't worry, I recently discovered a great article by Nikita Prokopov talking about Tahoe's [other icon problem](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/).) The \*OS 26 icons aren't amazing on any platform, but on iOS they weren't super different from the ones that were already in use, and overall add a bit more depth that I think is nice. On macOS though, the new icons brought changes that immediately bothered me. macOS icons have a unique style to them dating all the way back to OS X 10.0, and these icons seemed to be throwing that aside.

Before we can talk about Tahoe's icons, though, we need to talk about Big Sur's icons. When Apple last dramatically redesigned macOS in Big Sur, the icons followed suit and got an iOS-inspired look, in some cases using the exact same icon with an added depth effect between the layers. It was a good push towards making the icons uniform while still preserving the extra fun details that made Mac icons unique. And that's not just me talking, during the Big Sur reveal video Apple themselves said, "But we also love that Mac icons have a deep history and a distinct look and feel. So we've retained many of the highly crafted details and the playful elements that make Mac icons unique."<sup>[\[WWDC 2020\]](https://www.youtube.com/live/GEZhD3J89ZE?t=4276)</sup> These are details that have existed through most of the OS' history, so throwing them away would be crazy, right? Right?

Let's take a look at an example of this. GarageBand is one of my favorite examples of a _good_ icon redesign. The GarageBand icon that had been in use prior to Big Sur was a 3D guitar in front of your average amp. Like most OS X era icons, it was entirely freeform with just the two shapes next to each other. When they redesigned it, they simplified the amp down and made that fit the new shape constraints, but then kept the 3D guitar and let it break free from the icon's frame.

This icon does something that I absolutely adored from the Big Sur icon style: it uses a rounded square base to fit the format, and then has a 3D element that break frees of those constraints. It does a really good job of allowing for consistency without removing the fun details that made these icons memorable from previous versions of macOS. And GarageBand was far from alone, the majority of macOS icons that had some sort of eye-catching 3D object kept it in the transition to Big Sur.

But then, Tahoe came along. In Tahoe, the rounded square template isn't a suggestion anymore; Apple decided to make it a hard requirement. Icons that don't fit it are shrunk and placed on a square grey background. Unfortunately, this change means that these fun details had to go away, because 3D objects could no longer float outside of the square. This meant a new wave of redesigns, and my first wave of concern.

I think talking about Finder has already been done to death, so I'm not going to dwell on it for long, but it would be wrong of me to not mention it at all. Finder was one of the first Tahoe icons I properly saw, and I was immediately put off by it. Myself and many, many others were not a fan of Apple's bizarre decision to swap the colors of each half of Finder's face. Of all apps to make such a dramatic change to, Finder was kind of insane choice. The face has been colored the way it is since OS X 10.0 in _2001_. It's probably the single most recognizable icon in the entire operating system.

*Immediately screwing up Finder in beta 1 was a bad sign for the future.*

If the questionable choices had ended there, I would've been perplexed but ultimately fine with the whole ordeal since they did swap the colors back to the way they were supposed to be in 26.0 Beta 2. (Though perplexingly this is only true for the light icon, the dark icon _still_ [has the blue on the right side](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/Finder-Tahoe-Dark.png).)

Like I said though, critiquing the Tahoe Finder design has been done to death already. There are plenty of other examples of new icons that completely abandoned their unique design to become boring or even entirely unhelpful. My goal here isn't just to bitch and moan about them though, I want to convey exactly how I feel they fail to uphold their legacy and convey what the hell they actually do.

Let's start with Xcode, which I consider to be the most egregious example. (And I develop iOS apps so I have to stare at it _a lot,_ meaning I've had a lot of time to build up my frustration over it.)

Here's the progression of the Xcode icon over the years, from 2005 until now:

*Does one in particular maybe feel a little out of place to you too?*

Oh boy.

The Xcode icon being a blueprint has always felt really clever to me, and in Big Sur I think it was actually one of Apple's best icons overall. Especially since in Big Sur, the Xcode icon is literally a blueprint of the matching App Store icon with the iconic Xcode hammer on top. It's easily recognizable, and also has plenty of small details put into it.

But in Tahoe? It's a hammer. The grid behind it _kind of_ looks like a blank blueprint, but even then it's _blank_.

The Xcode icon also leads really well into my second major issue beyond legacy: conveying meaning. If you had no idea what an Xcode was, but you looked at any of the icons prior to Tahoe and put some thought into it, you could most likely come up with the correct answer that this is a tool for making apps. Especially on Big Sur if you put it right next to the App Store icon. The App Store is an A, this is the blueprint for that A, they must be related _somehow_.

But could you do the same with the Tahoe Xcode icon? I mean seriously, think about it. If you had no idea what Xcode was for, you would never be able to deduce it from looking at the icon. Obviously it is not a requirement that every app perfectly conveys what it does through its icon, but it should at least be possible to take an educated guess. And it's especially silly to simplify that meaning away when it had been communicated well for the past _20 years_.
