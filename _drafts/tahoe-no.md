desc: The Tahoe icons fail across the board, from ruining a legacy of icon design to failing to convey meaning in a way that's easily recognizable.

I've always tended to be an early adopter of Apple's software updates. I install the day 1 developer beta on my devices after WWDC each year, and then suffer the consequences of doing so (but hey, it's really fun to watch the improvements between the early betas). I stuck with that trend this year on my phone, but when it came to my Mac, I held off. I didn't have a supported Mac any previous year, but if I had been in the position to I would've installed the Sonoma or Sequoia betas when they release with no hesitation. Tahoe, however, was different.

I'm not a huge fan of Liquid Glass as a whole, but for the most part I've come to terms with it and was curious about it when it was new. I like that it makes things a bit less flat, but there are so many various glaring issues with it across all of Apple's OSes that I can't possibly say it's _good_. Either way, that wasn't my biggest concern with the design refresh. What got me was the icons. (And in my case, I mean the app icons. But don't worry, I recently discovered a great article by Nikita Prokopov talking about Tahoe's [other icon problem](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/).) The \*OS 26 icons aren't amazing on any platform, but on iOS they weren't super different from the ones that were already in use, and overall add a bit more depth that I think is nice. On macOS though, the new icons brought changes that immediately bothered me. macOS icons have a unique style to them dating all the way back to OS X 10.0, and these icons seemed to be throwing that aside.

## What We Had

Before we can talk about Tahoe's icons, though, we need to talk about Big Sur's icons. When Apple last dramatically redesigned macOS in Big Sur, the icons followed suit and got an iOS-inspired look, in some cases using the exact same icon with an added depth effect between the layers. It was a good push towards making the icons uniform while still preserving the extra fun details that made Mac icons unique. And that's not just me talking, during the Big Sur reveal video Apple themselves said, "But we also love that Mac icons have a deep history and a distinct look and feel. So we've retained many of the highly crafted details and the playful elements that make Mac icons unique."<sup>[\[WWDC 2020\]](https://www.youtube.com/live/GEZhD3J89ZE?t=4276)</sup> These are details that have existed through most of the OS' history, so throwing them away would be crazy, right? Right?

Let's take a look at an example of this. GarageBand is one of my favorite examples of a _good_ icon redesign. The GarageBand icon that had been in use prior to Big Sur was a 3D guitar in front of your average amp. Like most OS X era icons, it was entirely freeform with just the two shapes next to each other. When they redesigned it, they simplified the amp down and made that fit the new shape constraints, but then kept the 3D guitar and let it break free from the icon's frame.

*An example of a good redesign that preserved the details of the original icon.*

This icon does something that I absolutely adored from the Big Sur icon style: it uses a rounded square base to fit the format, and then has a 3D element that break frees of those constraints. It does a really good job of allowing for consistency without removing the fun details that made these icons memorable from previous versions of macOS. And GarageBand was far from alone, the majority of macOS icons that had some sort of eye-catching 3D object kept it in the transition to Big Sur.

But then, Tahoe came along. In Tahoe, the rounded square template isn't a suggestion anymore; Apple decided to make it a hard requirement. Icons that don't fit it are shrunk and placed on a square grey background. Unfortunately, this change means that these fun details had to go away, because 3D objects could no longer float outside of the square. This meant a new wave of redesigns, and my first wave of concern.

## What We Got

I think talking about Finder has already been done to death, so I'm not going to dwell on it for long, but it would be wrong of me to not mention it at all. Finder was one of the first Tahoe icons I properly saw, and I was immediately put off by it. Myself and many, many others were not a fan of Apple's bizarre decision to swap the colors of each half of Finder's face. Of all apps to make such a dramatic change to, Finder was kind of insane choice. The face has been colored the way it is since System 7.5.1 in _1995_. It's absolutely the single most recognizable icon in the entire operating system.

*Immediately screwing up Finder in beta 1 was a bad sign for the future.*

If the questionable choices had ended there, I would've been perplexed but ultimately fine with the whole ordeal since they did swap the colors back to the way they were supposed to be in 26.0 Beta 2. (Though perplexingly this is only true for the light icon, the dark icon _still_ [has the blue on the right side](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/Finder-Tahoe-Dark.png).) Unfortunately though, it did not end there.

Like I said though, critiquing the Tahoe Finder design has been done to death already. There are plenty of other examples of new icons that completely abandoned their unique design to become boring or even entirely unhelpful. My goal here isn't just to bitch and moan about them though, I want to convey exactly how I feel they fail to uphold their legacy and convey what the hell they actually do.

Let's continue with Xcode, which I consider to be the most egregious example. (And I develop iOS apps so I have to stare at it _a lot,_ meaning I've had a lot of time to build up my frustration over it.)

Here's the progression of the Xcode icon over the years, from 2005 until now:

![](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/Xcode-comparison.png)
*Does one in particular maybe feel a little out of place to you too?*

Hmm.

The Xcode icon being a blueprint has always felt like a really clever deign choice to me. And in Big Sur, I think it was actually one of Apple's best icons overall. It's easily recognizable, and has plenty of small details put into it.

But in Tahoe? Well, it's a hammer. The grid behind it _kind of_ looks like a blank blueprint, but even then it's a _blank_ blueprint. The visual motif of the App Store is completely gone, and with it went the icon's history.

This change to the Xcode icon also lends itself to being an example of my second issue with the Tahoe icons: a lack of any clearly defined meaning. If you had no idea what an Xcode was, but you looked at any of its icons prior to Tahoe and put some thought into it, you could most likely come up with the correct answer that this is a tool for making apps. Especially on Big Sur, if you put it right next to the App Store icon and see that they have the same base. The App Store is an A, this is the blueprint for that A, they're obviously related _somehow_.

But could you do the same with the Tahoe Xcode icon? I mean seriously, think about it. If you had no idea what Xcode was for, I don't think you would reasonably be able to deduce its purpose from looking at the icon alone. Obviously it's not a requirement that every single app has an elaborate icon that perfectly conveys what the app is used for, but I think that it should at least be detailed enough that you can take an educated guess. And I think it's especially ridiculous to simplify that meaning away when it's been communicated well for the past _20 years_. They figured out how to convey meaning perfectly. Why abandon that?

Aw crap hold on, my sink is leaking again. Anyone have a wrench I could borrow?

*Disk Utility, ColorSync Utility, and AppleScript Utility. Note that the dark mode Disk Utility icon was manually recreated from its components because extracting Tahoe icons is weird.*

Oh thank god.

I'm not going to try and pretend that these icons were anything special before, but they at least had a _little_ bit more variety. But now in Tahoe, they're almost the same icon. I mean really, besides changing the gradient on the wrench a little bit for whatever reason, the main difference between these three icons is the, relative to the size of the icon as a whole, fairly small hexagon in the center.

For the latter two, conveying meaning isn't _quite_ as important here. Editing your color profile and dealing with AppleScript files aren't things that are super easily conveyed through the app icon. A rainbow and a little AppleScript icon are probably the best we could expect.

But Disk Utility? What about this icon conveys _Disk Utility_? It's just an Apple logo on a white background. Let's pause and look at these side by side, just to make sure that we're on the same page.

![](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/DiskUtility-comparison.png)
*Disk Utility might not have been a looker but like... c'mon guys.*

Just like Xcode, Disk Utility is another example of both an icon's legacy and meaning being entirely stripped away. The old icon was clearly a tool for dealing with disks, it's a stethoscope on a hard drive, and that's what it was starting with OS X 10.3 in 2003. But what the hell does an Apple in a wrench mean? You can maybe guess that it's some form of system configuration, but disk management would not be at all on my radar if I didn't already know what it was.

I have one last major example for you. I give you, Preview:

![](/assets/blog-imgs/tahoe-no/Preview-comparison.png)
*Hey, it's Inkscape! Oh, wait, that's not an inkwell.*

The Preview icon from Big Sur is fun, it's the same example photo that they had been using since OS X 10.10 in 2014 with a very clear desk paper magnifier thing that, while looking in `Assets.car` to extract the icon, I learned is called a [loupe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loupe). It's also fun that it's outside the icon's frame, because it's like you have the loupe sitting on your desk ready to look at the photo.

In Tahoe, they have completely abandoned the example photo and just have the loupe on its own, which I find pretty bland. Additionally, while you can tell what it is and read the little "PREVIEW 10X" when it's big, you lose all of that clarity once you scale it down to actual app icon size. I've seen it on my phone for almost a year now, and my Mac for several months, and I _still_ see it as an inkwell first every time I look at it. I mean it's the right shape, and I expect to see a photo in Preview's icon so I don't really see this and think Preview. It gets even worse when using dark mode, because the black background and darker glass almost makes it look (to me at least) like there's ink inside!

## The macOS Icon Legacy

And now we arrive at the part where I need to summarize my thoughts.

I understand that the design of app icons is somewhat subjective. But I also know that at least a large portion of macOS users are very fond of its design.
