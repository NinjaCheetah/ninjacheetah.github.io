# rustii
rustii is a library and command line tool written in Rust for handling the various files and formats found on the Wii. rustii is a port of my other library, [libWiiPy](/projects/libWiiPy), which aims to accomplish the same goal in Python. Compared to libWiiPy, rustii is in its very early stages of development and is missing most of the features present in its Python counterpart. The goal is for rustii and libWiiPy to eventually have feature parity, with the rustii CLI acting as a drop-in replacement for the (comparatively much less efficient) [WiiPy](/projects/wiipy) CLI.
